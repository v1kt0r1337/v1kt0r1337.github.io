                As the Frontend tech lead, my responsibilities included creating

                This involved implementing code reviews, proper git workflows,
                and establishing routines surrounding third party dependencies.
                I also took charge of maintaining adherence to the chosen
                architecture. Helped project managers by breaking down customer
                and technical needs into user stories, acceptance criterias
                etc... Worked closely with the Head of Test and Quality
                Assurance and other leads, to development robust release
                routines to ensure smooth and reliable product deployments.

              <h2>Parking lot tracker <span>2017</span></h2>
              <p>
                A parking lot tracker that aimed to monitor the availability of
                parking spaces. The system utilized a Raspberry Pi with a camera
                module, running a Python program integrated with OpenCV. The
                program tracked the movement of cars entering and exiting
                parking lots. Whenever a car left a parking lot, an API call was
                made to a server application to increment or decrement the
                available parking spaces count. Additionally, the project
                included a mobile application developed using React Native and
                TypeScript. The app integrated with Google Maps to display
                tracked parking lots near the user's location. Users could view
                the number of empty spots in each parking lot.

              <h2>Kompetansetorget - Bachelor project<span>2016</span></h2>
              <p>
                My bachelor project was for Kompetansetorget UiA. The project
                consisted of a mobile application along with its dedicated
                server application. The mobile app was developed using Xamarin
                C#, while the server application was built with ASP.NET C#.
                Originally, the intention was to create a fully functional
                application for Kompetansetorget. However, due to the
                unavailability of an API and the risks associated with scraping
                and injecting data into their existing website, it was decided
                to transform the project into a working prototype. The prototype
                allowed users to browse and view job listings and assignments on
                Kompetansetorget. In this project, my responsibilities included
                writing the backend code, managing Azure services, handling most
                of the frontend logic, and serving as the scrum master.

                Mobile development for a golf application. The main concept of
                the app was to track your golf progress. In the app you would
                first entered the golf field then specify the hole you were
                playing on. During the game, the app allowed users to keep their
                phones in their pockets and utilize the volume buttons to record
                each swing attempt, enabling convenient tracking of progress on
                each hole. In addition, the application featured skill progress
                graphs to help users visualize their improvement over time. The
                project never got completed/released.

                A school project where we recreated some of the key features of
                the infamous learning platform - itslearning, in a desktop
                application. My main role in this project was creating the
                server application and the desktop application's notification
                system.
